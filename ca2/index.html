            hello and welcome to wombat survivor!
            The premise is simple: you are the last wombat, struggling to survive in the zombie apocalypse.
            Survive for as long as you can and enact vengeance for your fallen wombat brethren using the high speed dash that all wombats are born with (double tap directional keys), but beware, you will be vulnerable on the rebound.
            survive against:

            <br>
            <img src="skeleton_faceset.png" alt="skeleton face set">
            <br>
            The most basic of the undead, slowly move towards you before backing up and unleashing a huge lunge. Easy to avoid, but numerous.
            <br>
            <img src="ninja_faceset.png" alt="ninja face set">
            <br>
            A zombie ninja, moves quickly due to their previous life, but tire easily.
            <br>
            <img src="zombat_faceset.png" alt="ninja face set">
            <br>
            Your corrupted brethren, will use the same moves you have to end you.
